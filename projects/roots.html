      <h1 class="ani1">About</h1>

      <p class="ani2">
        Roots of Success is an <strong>environmental literacy curriculum</strong> designed to give people in underserved and impoverished communities the education necessary to begin their careers. The program caters towards several audiences, including former prisoners, people discharged from rehabilitation facilities, and people living in communities without sufficient monetary or educational resources.
      </p>

      <p class="ani2">
        I am currently <strong>leading a project for Blueprint</strong>, a UC Berkeley organization that builds applications <strong>pro-bono</strong> for non-profits. My team of four developers and I are creating a web platform for Roots of Success to host all of their course modules and materials, ranging from presentation slides to videos to audio clips (to provide an alternative to in-classroom teaching). Our aim is to aid the non-profit in <strong>scaling their potential impact</strong>, providing a digitalized curriculum to augment the effectiveness of their current physical classroom environment.
